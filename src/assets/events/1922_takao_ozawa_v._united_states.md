# Takao Ozawa v. United States (1922)

Takao Ozawa v. United States (1922) is a case heard before the Supreme Court in which Takao Ozawa, an immigrant residing in Hawaii, petitioned for citizenship on the basis of his “light complexion”, which allowed him to qualify as “white” because he had been denied citizenship based upon race prior to this petition. The court ruled that “white” was “of the Caucasian race” which excluded Ozawa from qualifying for citizenship. This upheld the 1790 Nationality Act that stipulated Asians were ineligible for naturalization. Specifically limiting the ability of Asian Americans to become citizens. This case set the precedents and parameters for future immigration acts including the Johnson Reed Act of 1924.

# Bhagat Singh Thind v. United States (1923)

Bhagat Singh Thind was a high caste Hindu, of full Indian blood, born at Amrit Sar, Punjab, India. He applied for citizenship and was granted citizenship which was later revoked. He petitioned his case in Bhagat Singh Thind v. United States (1923). The ruling determined he was ineligible for citizenship because at the time he would not be considered “white” by the “common man” even though Asian Indians were categorized as Aryan or caucasian. This contradicted the ruling in Ozawa v. U.S. About fifty Asian Indian Americans had their citizenship revoked based upon this ruling.

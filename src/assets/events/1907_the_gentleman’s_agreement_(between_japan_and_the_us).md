# The Gentleman’s Agreement (between Japan and the US) (1907)

The Gentleman’s Agreement (between Japan and the US) (1907) was an informal agreement between US and Japan. Japan agreed to no longer issue passports to its laborers who wanted to go to the US. Koreans also fell under this because Korea was a protectorate of Japan. The motivation of the agreement was driven by California’s wishes to limit immigration. This restricted other Asian immigrants beyond Chinese. However, it was not as restrictive as previous acts, resulting in a more balanced gender population for the Japanese American population. Thus fueling motivation for further acts to restrict Asian immigration.

# Johnson Reed Immigration Act (1924)

The Johnson Reed Immigration Act (1924) set immigration quotas based upon country of origin. The quota was based upon two percent of the population of each nationality in the US. While this impacted the immigration of Asians, it more significantly affected immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. This act had a direct link to the holocaust,as a result of denying entry of European Jews seeking asylum to the US during World War II.

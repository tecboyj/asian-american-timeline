# Page Act (1875)

The Page Act of 1875 targeted laborers from “China, Japan or any Oriental country” and anyone, presumably women who was coming for “lewd and immoral purposes”. This was the first immigration law, while not specifically restricting Asian immigration based on race, restricted immigration based on restricting persons whose “category” of labor was perceived to be immoral. This act had a negative impact on the AANHPI community because it disproportionately restricted Asian women, based on the perception that they were seeking work for “lewd and immoral purposes”, in other words prostitution. This changed the gender ratio of the Chinese American population as well as created stereotypes of Asian women of being immoral.

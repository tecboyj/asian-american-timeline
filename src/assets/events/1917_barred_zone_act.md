# Barred Zone Act (1917)

The Barred Zone Act of 1917 was a restrictive Act limiting immigration. The Act included a literacy test to demonstrate reading comprehension, raised immigration taxes upon those entering, and provided for more discretion in restricting those who could immigrate. It prohibited immigration from a “Barred Zone” spanning from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. This act significantly impacted Asians of the Indian subcontinent. But was not its only purpose, it was to limit overall immigration. World War I and the turmoil that it created, facilitated the passing of this Act by the US Congress. This Act negatively impacted the AANHPI community by further limiting immigrations and significantly impacted their ability to apply for US citizenship.

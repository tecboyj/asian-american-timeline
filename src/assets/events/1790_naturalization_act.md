# Naturalization Act

1790  
Naturalization Act (1790)

Who or what is the focus of this event or act?

The Naturalization Act only alowed "free White persons" the ability to recive american citizenship.

Provide background/context of the law, act, event, or court case and what it did and mention the date of its occurrence.

The requirement that you need to be a certain race to be granted American citizenship was still in place in one form or another until the McCarran-Walter Act in 1952.

Did this event have a positive or negative impact on the AANHPI community?
Explain using details/evidence from your research.

Not being able to become an American citizen limited the rights and protections Asian Americans had. Asians were often denied entry to the country based off of their class, gender, or "race". The Naturalization Act enabled the idea that Asian Americans are perpetual forigners, if they weren't American citizens then they must be here temporarily for work or vacation.

Explain how this event affected American history overall.
For example, in the case of Wong Kim Ark, what impact did it have on both AANHPI people and everyone born in the United States?

Not being seen as fellow Americans, Asian Americans faced a lot of discrimination, and without the protections of being American citizens there was little they could do to fight back. An Asian American Family could have a normal day one day and the next they might be deported or worse.

CHALLENGE:
If possible, describe another notable event in American history that happened at the same time but usually gets more attention than the one in your timeline. How has that event overshadowed or drawn attention away from this event in Asian American history?

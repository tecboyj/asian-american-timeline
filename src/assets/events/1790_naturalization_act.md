# Naturalization Act (1790)

Introduced in the Naturalization Act in 1790, to become an American citizen you needed to be a "free White person". Only people of certain races and ethnicities could be granted citizenship untill the McCarran-Walter Act in 1952 removed all race requirements to be granted American Citizenship.

Not being able to become an American citizen limited the rights and protections Asian Americans had. Asians were often denied entry to the country based off of their class, gender, or "race". The Naturalization Act enabled the idea that Asian Americans are perpetual forigners, if they weren't American citizens then they must be here temporarily for work or vacation. Not being seen as fellow Americans, Asian Americans faced a lot of discrimination, and without the protections of being American citizens there was little they could do to fight back. An Asian American Family could have a normal day one day and the next they might be deported or worse.

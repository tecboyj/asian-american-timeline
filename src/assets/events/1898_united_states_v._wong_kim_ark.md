# United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898)

Wong Kim Ark was born in San Francisco, California to Chinese citizens who were residing in California at the time of his birth. His parents had returned to China after residing in the US for over 20 years. At the age of 21, Wong Kim Ark left the US to visit his parents in China. Upon his return, he was denied entry. United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) was a case that challenged the 14th amendment that he was a US citizen based on being born in the US. The Supreme Court decided Wong Kim Ark was a US citizen because he was born in the US to parents who were not “employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China.” The ruling established the parameters of the concept known as jus soli—the citizenship of children born in the United States to non-citizens. This changed the tides in the paths to citizenship for many immigrants, not just Asian American Immigrants.

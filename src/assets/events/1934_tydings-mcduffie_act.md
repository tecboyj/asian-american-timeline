# Tydings-McDuffie Act (1934)

In 1934, the Philippines was a US colony, making Filipinos US nationals. Due to their status, they could not be excluded from immigration by prior acts like other Asians. With pressure from the western states over Filipinos competing with poor whites for agricultural jobs, Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act (1934). The act limited immigration of Filipinos to 50 per year and promised the Philippines eventual independence. Due to World War II, independence was delayed till after the war. The path to independence prevented Filipinos already in the US from leaving due to being prevented from returning.

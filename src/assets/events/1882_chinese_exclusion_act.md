# Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 forbade the immigration of Chinese laborers for a period of 10 years, barred them from being naturalized citizens, and prohibited those already in the US from bringing their families. The Page Act of 1875 set the stage for this act. This was a change in US immigration policy by targeting immigrants based on their country of origin and socioeconomic status, changing us to a gatekeeping country rather than a nation of immigrants. This Act was a precursor to subsequent laws not only in the US but also in establishing exclusionary policies in boarder countries of Canada and Mexico. The Act had further socioeconomic impacts by allowing certain “exempt classes” to enter. Specifically merchants who became elites in the Chinese American urban communities. It also controlled the Chinese immigrant population and slowed down their reproductive rate for more than a generation ensuring that the political power of the Chinese American community would develop more slowly than that of other immigrant and ethnic groups in the US.
